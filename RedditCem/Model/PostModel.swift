If you haven't seen it yet, Rad is a zero-dependency framework for creating web apps. It has all the best bits of Flutter(widgets) &amp; React(performance), and best of all, it's written in 100% Dart, which means you can use your favorite language to create frontends for the web. I appreciate all the feedback I got when I first posted about it. Since then, a lot of work has been done on the architecture and features to make it usable for production. Stable release will be available in a week(I won't spam about it here). I'm just sharing it now in-case anyone wants to try it out before stable release gets out and if you have any suggestions/issues feel free to comment here, or use [GH isssues](https://github.com/erlage/rad/issues) or [email](mailto:eralge.inc@gmail.com). ### Quick links: - [Package](https://pub.dev/packages/rad) - [Repository](https://github.com/erlage/rad) - [Benchmarks](https://github.com/erlage/rad-benchmarks) Thanks for reading!
